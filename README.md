# Alfonso - Secretary Discord Bot

## Functions
Alfonso is your personal Discord Server Secreatary. His starting functions will include setting reminders, polls, and timers. More functions will be added after that. 
The initial idea behind Alfonso is to make planning events in between memebrs of the server easier by having these timers, polls, reminders, etc. present in the chat and keeping everyone informed.
As more functions are added Alfonso's tasks will become broader to the point where he will make server management easier, not just event planning easier.

## Commands
### Instructions
$ahelp - pulls up general instructions

$atimers - pulls up timer instructions 

$areminders - pulls up reminder instructions

$apolls - pulls up poll instructions

### Timers
For now timers can only be set, in the future they will be able to be deleted.

$ast name # - sets a timer named "name" for "#" seconds

$amt name # - sets a timer named "name" in minutes

$aht name # - sets a timer named "name" in hours

$at [name\] [hh;mm;ss] - sets a timer named "name" for the set time	

	ex: $at lunch 1;05;00 - set a timer for an hour and 5 minutes from now

For now formatting is strict for all the timer commands, so for proper results stick to the outlined format.
