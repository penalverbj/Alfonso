# Alfonso - Secretary Discord Bot

## Functions
Alfonso is your personal Discord Server Secreatary. His starting functions will include setting reminders, polls, and timers. More functions will be added after that. 
The initial idea behind Alfonso is to make planning events in between memebrs of the server easier by having these timers, polls, reminders, etc. present in the chat and keeping everyone informed.
As more functions are added Alfonso's tasks will become broader to the point where he will make server management easier, not just event planning easier.
